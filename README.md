## Overview  
I participated in the **Zenith Hackathon** as part of a team of three, 
where we focused on **cybersecurity and web scraping using OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)**. 
Our project involved leveraging **Google API** and **Twitter API** for data extraction and analysis while 
implementing **file handling** techniques to process and store the gathered information efficiently.
